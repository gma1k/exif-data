Exchangeable Image File data

EXIF data is a type of metadata that is stored in digital images. 
It stands for Exchangeable Image File and it contains information about the camera, the settings, the location, the date and time, and other details of the photo. 

It is very important to delete or fake EXIF data before you post it online because EXIF data can reveal a lot of information about you and your pictures that you may not want to share with others.
